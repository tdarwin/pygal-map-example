# PyMap

This isn't even a library, it's just a quick example of using python to generate a world map with custom-color-coded continents.

To get this running:

```shell
pip3 install venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
python pymap.py
```

This should generate a map image named world.png.  Have Fun!
